# Denoising Diffusion Models with Pytorch

In this project, our main task was to adapt the ”DDPM” model outlined in the paper "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models". Doing so involves using PyTorch, specifically with both the MNIST dataset and CIFAR10 data set. Our aim was to implement the paper’s methods and parameters exactly and replicate results in terms of image clarity, diversity and FID score. It was possible to reach satisfactory results with MNIST, however with CIFAR10 longer training is needed.
